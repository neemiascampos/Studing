The fb library is what is responsible for almost all of the software
rendering that your X Server might do.

You're probably mostly spending your time in fbComposite() and its
children, which is the Render extension software implementation. Some
drivers have hardware implementations of this, and we're working on
making this be the case for more hardware.
